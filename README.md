# BallProject
Sam and Angélique worked on the living rock features while Tanzim and Vincent worked on the interface and ball parts.

## 05-06-19
- Tanzim worked on making a basic visual of a ball (making a randomly colored circle), while Vincent tried working on motion (first basic border-hitting motion, then including gravity).
-Angélique typed while Sam gave instructions on loading an image We edited the images to be random and fit the square model.

## 05-07-19
- Tanzim and Vincent worked together on coding isTouchable() and the Collideable interface.
-Sam typed while Angélique gave instructions on adding eyes to the living rock.

## 05-08-19
- Vincent was absent for a choral trip and was not able to do work. Tanzim tried working on some weird isTouching function for ball,failed miserably.
-Angélique typed while Sam gave instructions on editing the path of motion for the rock and also editing the setup.

## 05-09-19
- Tanzim was out sick, and was not able to do work. Vincent wrote a weird sinusoidal motion type of ball.
-Sam typed while Angélique gave instructions on how to adjust the eyes and fix the parameters for the motions of the objects.

## 05-13-19
-Sam worked on having the rock implement collideable and figuring out a movement pattern for it to follow when it collides with another object.
